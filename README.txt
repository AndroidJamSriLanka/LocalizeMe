LocalizeMe is a android app to localize the user in a simple way. If you are a stranger to a area you would like to know about places nearby. If there is a person telling you "Hey, are you looking for a Coffee shop? Thare is a place nearby. Here are other's today tips". So LocalizeMe is a kind of a cool app providing us cool features with geofencing technology. It tracks user's location and give nearby sugessions. User can search near by locations and filter them. All the results are representing in a Map and user can get directions and location more interactively.

I have used foursquare web API for location information. And I have used Google map API for map representation with Google geofence API for proximity alerts.

I have implemented UI design and data handling part. Still to do more job with including geofencing technology.
